Introduction**\n","\n","The goal of the assignment is to implement a system for image classification. In other words, this system should tell if there is an object of given class in an image. You will perform 5-class ({1: *airplanes*, 2: *birds*, 3: *ships*, 4: *horses*, 5: *automobiles*}) image classification based on a bag-of-words approach ([reference](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~az/icvss08_az_bow.pdf)) using SIFT features. [CIFAR10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) will be used for the task. For each class, the test sub-directories contain 1000 images, and the training sub-directories contain 5000 images.

Now, we take the Support Vector Machine (SVM) as an example. As a result, we will have 5 *binary* classifiers.\n","\n","Take images from the training set of the related class (should be the ones which you did not use for dictionary calculation). Represent them with histograms of visual words as discussed in the previous section. Use at least 50 training images per class or more, but remember to debug your code first! If you use the default setting, you should have 50 histograms of size 1000. These will be your positive examples.\n","\n","Then, you will obtain histograms of visual words for images from other classes, again about 50 images per class, as negative examples. Therefore, you will have 200 negative examples.\n","\n","Now, you are ready to train a classifier. You should repeat it for each class. To classify a new image, you should calculate its visual words histogram as described in Section 2.4 and use the trained SVM classifier to assign it to the most probable object class. (Note that for proper SVM scores you need to use cross-validation to get a proper estimate of the SVM parameters.
