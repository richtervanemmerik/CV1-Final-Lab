Introduction**\n","\n","The goal of the assignment is to implement a system for image classification. In other words, this system should tell if there is an object of given class in an image. You will perform 5-class ({1: *airplanes*, 2: *birds*, 3: *ships*, 4: *horses*, 5: *automobiles*}) image classification based on a bag-of-words approach ([reference](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~az/icvss08_az_bow.pdf)) using SIFT features. [CIFAR10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) will be used for the task. For each class, the test sub-directories contain 1000 images, and the training sub-directories contain 5000 images. Images are represented as (RGB) 32x32 pixels.\n","\n","Download the [dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-10-python.tar.gz).

This option is to allow for a more manageable workload, especially if computational resources are limited. If applicable, consider the effects of using this smaller set of images on the quality of your implementation.\n","\n","**Hint:**\n","In a real scenario, the public data you use often deviates from your task.
